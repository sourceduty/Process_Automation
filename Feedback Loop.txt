Explanation:

1. Trigger Event (Action): The user presses a button, starting the process.
2. Immediate Reaction: A signal is sent to a machine.
3. Secondary Action: The machine starts operating.
4. Conditional Check: If the machine encounters an error, it sends an alert.
5. Tertiary Reaction: An alert is sent to the user.
6. Final Action: The user acknowledges the alert and resolves the issue.
7. Feedback Loop: Information from the final action is fed back to the Trigger Event, completing the loop.

This diagram shows the horizontal process flow with the feedback loop clearly looping back to the first block. I hope this meets your requirements. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
