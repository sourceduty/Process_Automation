Simple Manufacturing Process Diagram Example

Places:

P1: Raw materials available
P2: Assembly in progress
P3: Product assembled
P4: Quality check in progress
P5: Product approved
P6: Product packaged
P7: Product shipped

Transitions:

T1: Start assembly
T2: Complete assembly
T3: Start quality check
T4: Approve product
T5: Package product
T6: Ship product

Arcs:

P1 -> T1
T1 -> P2
P2 -> T2
T2 -> P3
P3 -> T3
T3 -> P4
P4 -> T4
T4 -> P5
P5 -> T5
T5 -> P6
P6 -> T6
T6 -> P7

Initial Marking:

P1 (1)  # Raw materials available
P2 (0)
P3 (0)
P4 (0)
P5 (0)
P6 (0)
P7 (0)

Final Marking:

P1 (0)
P2 (0)
P3 (0)
P4 (0)
P5 (0)
P6 (0)
P7 (1)  # Product shipped

Explanation:

1. Places (P1-P7) represent different states in the manufacturing process.
2. Transitions (T1-T6) represent activities that cause state changes.
3. Arcs show the flow between places and transitions.
4. Initial Marking sets the starting condition, with raw materials available.
5. Final Marking shows the end condition, with the product shipped.

This plain text representation can be used to understand the flow and structure of the manufacturing process in a Petri Net model.
